# About Me

* Based in the United Kingdom, also just based in general.

* Part time FOSS developer when not bound by the inescapable shackles of Rishi Sunak's education system.

* Firing through your windsheild is always the last resort, glass blowback can get in your lungs and obstruct vision of the target so open the door/window first.
